<br>
<br><strong><em>Course Description
<br></em></strong>In 2008, Roy Ascott provocatively asserted: “the digital moment has passed.” New innovations in the arts are now being labeled “postdigital,” a term that signals the “humanization” of technologies, or the fusion across digital and pre-digital platforms to allow for the integration of the human actor or participant. Indeed, English musician and composer Jem Finer has defined the “postdigital” as “a return to a tactile relationship with ideas and materials informed by over 30 years of working with computers. A practice that seeks to transcend mediation via a screen and locate itself in the physical world, rather than at one stage removed, through digital representation.” In other words, whereas the digital is concerned with hyperreal and virtual scenarios, the postdigital engages digital technologies in the service of concerns facing the real world, including issues related to the environment, social inequity, privacy, and information control. Our critical inquiry will thus engage with concerns central to postdigital media, taking shape around these questions: In what ways has our thinking changed as a result of digital media? How, in turn, have digital technologies altered both our environment and our methods of and abilities to communicate with one another? As user-participants of new media texts, in what ways are we implicated in stories that use new media technologies? Likewise, how should we read and interpret new media, including films, comic books, and “twitter” fiction? What are the specific formal methods that various kinds of technologies employ in order to communicate content, and how do stories change as they are adapted across media platforms? We will explore these questions through the three units around which this course has been structured: Unit 1: Digital Changes: Restructuring Thought Unit 2: New Forms and Modes: Interpreting Media Unit 3: Translations: Storytelling across Media Each of these units will culminate in a substantial writing project.</p>

<br>
<br><strong><em>Course Description
<br></em></strong>In his magnum opus, The Man Without Qualities, Robert Musil writes: “The difference between a normal person and an insane one is precisely that the normal person has all the diseases of the mind, while the madman has only one.” Sanity and insanity, normalcy and madness, reality and fiction: Modern psychology has suggested that these divisions are constructed, dependent upon the stories that we tell and the rationalizations that we make. Our critical inquiry will thus take shape around these questions: Is there a normative way of seeing reality? To what extent is “the real” a narrative fiction? What are the historical and cultural valences surrounding the concept of madness, and how have these valences shaped the ways that we understand both our own positions and that of others within the world? In what ways have we represented aberrant or “transgressive” thinking in art, both verbal and visual? Are such transgressions merely the product of a historical moment, or are they rather attempts to reveal some elemental truth about the society in which we live? We will explore these questions through three units around which this course has been structured: Unit 1: Troubling the Divisions: Normalcy vs. Madness Unit 2: Questioning the Definitions: Histories and Cultures of Madness Unit 3: Representing the Mind: The Art of Madness Each of these units will culminate in a substantial writing project.</p>
